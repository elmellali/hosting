                            <li>The Goods were purchased in the last 30 days</li>
                            <li>The Goods are in the original packaging</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following Goods cannot be returned:</p>

                            <li>The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.</li>
                            <li>The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned,
                                deteriorate rapidly or where the date of expiry is over.</li>
                            <li>The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene
                                reasons and were unsealed after delivery.</li>
                            <li>The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed
                                with other items.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We may refuse returns that do not meet the conditions above, to the extent permitted by
                            applicable law.</p>
                        <p>Only regular priced Goods may be refunded. Unfortunately, Goods on sale cannot be refunded. This
                            exclusion may not apply to You if it is not permitted by applicable law.</p>
                        <h2>Returning Goods</h2>
                        <p>You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Goods to Us.</p>
                        <p>You should send the Goods at the following address:</p>
                        <p>3831 Montgomery Blvd NE APT 433<br />
                            Albuquerque, NM 87109</p>
                        <p>We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, We
                            recommend an insured and trackable mail service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual
                            receipt of the Goods or proof of received return delivery.</p>
                        <h2>Gifts</h2>
                        <p>If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped directly to you, You'll
                            receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned product is received, a
                            gift certificate will be mailed to You.</p>
                        <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to
                            themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.</p>
